Compilation of Assignments and Projects of Course SEP787: Machine Learning Classification

These algorithms are coded fundamentally i.e no in-built library is used.  

In the py files, a comparison is made between the fundamental code and code using sklearn's in-built library.  

Models:  
1. Fisher's Linear Discriminant  
2. Naive Bayes
